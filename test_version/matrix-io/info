Matlab files to create, read, and write rectangular m x n matrices A for 
least squares problems

    min_x ||Ax-b||

These only set up the matrix A; for the right-hand side vector initialize
it in your own code to have

    b(i) = 1/i, for i = 1:m

Using 1/i is intended to make clear that the indexing shown is 1-based; the
formula needs to be shifted if you use C++ or Fortran 0-based indexing.
Be sure to read and understand the comments in createsystem.m; the other
files should work without problem, and the only one you need edit is
createsystem.m, to change the sizes m and n. The files readmatrix.m and
testreadwrite.m are not needed for P573. The files here include: 

----------------
createsystem.m
----------------
This will set up a file with the coefficient matrix A. Read the info in it.

--------------
readmatrix.m
writematrix.m 
--------------
Short functions to read/write an array from/to an ASCII file to full
17-digit precision, allowing I/O to and from C++/Fortran with complete
reproducibility. For p573, you only need to write the linear system from
Matlab, then read it into your own code. The Matlab reader is just there
for completeness.

The I/O functions can treat the array as sparse but are set up to read and
write dense matrices. Change returnsparse in readmatrix.m and writesparse
in writematrix if you want sparsity to be exploited. In that case, initialize
your array to all zeros, then only assign values to the entries that are
specified in the input file. For P573, just use dense matrices.


----------------
testreadwrite.m
----------------
A script for testing both read and write functions. You don't need this
one for the assignment.
